"What issue does consistency training face?","rehearsal","['One aim shared by multiple settings, such as continual learning or transfer\nlearning, is to leverage previously acquired knowledge to converge faster on\nthe current task. Usually this is done through fine-tuning, where an implicit\nassumption is that the network maintains its plasticity, meaning that the\nperformance it can reach on any given task is not affected negatively by\npreviously seen tasks. It has been observed recently that a pretrained model on\ndata from the same distribution as the one it is fine-tuned on might not reach\nthe same generalisation as a freshly initialised one. We build and extend this\nobservation, providing a hypothesis for the mechanics behind it. We discuss the\nimplication of losing plasticity for continual learning which heavily relies on\noptimising pretrained models.', 'Despite significant advances, continual learning models still suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting when exposed to incrementally available data from\nnon-stationary distributions. Rehearsal approaches alleviate the problem by\nmaintaining and replaying a small episodic memory of previous samples, often\nimplemented as an array of independent memory slots. In this work, we propose\nto augment such an array with a learnable random graph that captures pairwise\nsimilarities between its samples, and use it not only to learn new tasks but\nalso to guard against forgetting. Empirical results on several benchmark\ndatasets show that our model consistently outperforms recently proposed\nbaselines for task-free continual learning.', 'This paper proposes a Transformer-based model to generate equations for math\nword problems. It achieves much better results than RNN models when copy and\nalign mechanisms are not used, and can outperform complex copy and align RNN\nmodels. We also show that training a Transformer jointly in a generation task\nwith two decoders, left-to-right and right-to-left, is beneficial. Such a\nTransformer performs better than the one with just one decoder not only because\nof the ensemble effect, but also because it improves the encoder training\nprocedure. We also experiment with adding reinforcement learning to our model,\nshowing improved performance compared to MLE training.']","['A study on the plasticity of neural networks', 'Graph-Based Continual Learning', 'Solving Math Word Problems with Double-Decoder Transformer']","[""['cs.LG']"", ""['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']"", ""['cs.LG', 'cs.CL']""]","[0.8533754944801331, 0.840000331401825, 0.8355044722557068]","","","","Incorrect","No","The generated answer ""rehearsal"" does not directly address the question about the issues that consistency training faces.

More specifically, estimation of the\nsign of the difference between probability densities of two unlabeled datasets\ngives the solution. We then introduce a new method to directly estimate the\nsign of the density difference without density estimation.

"How can data-driven insights optimize customer support in retail environments?","a customer state updating step","[""In order to better engage with customers, retailers rely on extensive\ncustomer and product databases which allows them to better understand customer\nbehaviour and purchasing patterns. This has long been a challenging task as\ncustomer modelling is a multi-faceted, noisy and time-dependent problem. The\nmost common way to tackle this problem is indirectly through task-specific\nsupervised learning prediction problems, with relatively little literature on\nmodelling a customer by directly simulating their future transactions. In this\npaper we propose a method for generating realistic sequences of baskets that a\ngiven customer is likely to purchase over a period of time. Customer embedding\nrepresentations are learned using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which takes\ninto account the entire sequence of transaction data. Given the customer state\nat a specific point in time, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained\nto generate a plausible basket of products for the following week. The newly\ngenerated basket is then fed back into the RNN to update the customer's state.\nThe GAN is thus used in tandem with the RNN module in a pipeline alternating\nbetween basket generation and customer state updating steps. This allows for\nsampling over a distribution of a customer's future sequence of baskets, which\nthen can be used to gain insight into how to service the customer more\neffectively. The methodology is empirically shown to produce baskets that\nappear similar to real baskets and enjoy many common properties, including\nfrequencies of different product types, brands, and prices. Furthermore, the\ngenerated data is able to replicate most of the strongest sequential patterns\nthat exist between product types in the real data."", 'E-commerce business is revolutionizing our shopping experiences by providing\nconvenient and straightforward services.

In this paper, we tackle this problem in the context\nof market segment demand prediction. The goal is to facilitate the learning\nprocess in the target segments by leveraging the learned knowledge from\ndata-sufficient source segments.
